Gini impurity is the measure of stochasticity or one-ness of a dataset. The max gini impurity is 0.5 (when each class present in the data has equal number of observations, i.e. very chaotic)
and the min is 0 (all observations belong to exactly one class). Its formaula is sum(p(class)[1-p(class)])
Trees want minimized gini impurity at each node, as it shows that the data at that node is becoming purer
decision trees do not need to be scaled!
decision-trees do tend to be overfitted.
